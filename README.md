FIELD TO HOME

# Problem
Many local farmers are actually not getting complete money on their produce which is mostly captured by middle men and to remove that middle man we are building a bridge between farmers and customers for selling farm products directly to the them in order to get maximum benefit to the farmers.

# Solution
We are going to build a bridge between customers and farmers by creating a website where all the farmers can create their portal where they can do their businesses with customers in our portal.

Actually this is going to be a start-up idea but for this event to bring our idea into action we are considering small range of grocery vendors and the customers who need groceries.

In our website farmer provides the information regarding the vegetables and fruits that he wants to trade or sell. Then users in our portal can search for the goods they want to buy and we assign our delivery person to get the vegetables and fruits from near by local farmer in our portal.

As per The Farm Bill 2020 amendment the sole aim was to remove the middle men who are gaining a lot of money from blood and sweat of farmers who are dying out of hunger so this is our small initiative to get farmer’s products directly to customers so that farmers can get maximum profit.

# Delivery and Payment Process
As pandemic is going on and there are many contaminant zones where people can’t get outside, by keeping this in mind we assign a delivery person from our side whose is nearby to the ordered place with security and health assurances of the delivery person.

That delivery person will get information about the orders and information about nearby available vendor so that we can deliver the products in short time with quality assurance. It mainly takes up the current conditions outside and will not arise any pandemic breakout.

The payment procedure will be done at the time of delivery with all types of digital payment and also cash which is directly sent to farmers by the end of every day.

Delivery charges will be free for goods more than a certain amount or else our share of delivery charges will be charged. 

# Uses
From this all local sellers can get opportunity to sell their goods to a wide range of people with minimum support price and the users can get goods from local sellers.

In order to avoid solitary demand for a single seller we are keeping minimum support price and threshold maximum price for the groceries that they are selling, so that we can assure the price range is reasonable to user as well as to vendors.

We assure health and safety of customer as well as quality of product to be main priority.
